# Amplifier for 8ohm 0.25W speaker
__WARNING__: WIP, this is still under development


## Requirements
- Variable output amplitude (gain)
- Variable frequency (should not contain fixed frequency oscillator)
- Transistors only (no opamps, ...)
- No trimming required (should not need matching transistors nor adjusting
  trimmers)
- May be a switching amplifier, no need for a linear one
